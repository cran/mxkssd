Description: Generates efficient balanced mixed-level k-circulant supersaturated designs by interchanging the elements of the generator vector. Attempts to generate a supersaturated design that has EfNOD efficiency more than user specified efficiency level (mef). Displays the progress of generation of an efficient mixed-level k-circulant design through a progress bar. The progress of 100 per cent means that one full round of interchange is completed. More than one full round (typically 4-5 rounds) of interchange may be required for larger designs. For more details, please see Mandal, B.N., Gupta V. K. and Parsad, R. (2011).
